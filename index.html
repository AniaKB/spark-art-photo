      Our company has used Spark Art for professional headshots, group pictures, and marketing photos on a few different occasions.
      Each time they have exceeded all expectations.
      They make everyone involved in the photo shoot feel comfortable and confident.
      The final product is always well edited and sharp. Our experiences with Dave and Emily have always been positive and we could not recommend them more highly!
      Great company. Great people. Great products!

      I recently used Spark Art for my professional headshot.
      Scheduling was a breeze.
      Emily was energetic and fun to work with and, best of all, the pictures came out great!
